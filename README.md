## 🎨 About the project
This is my first website, I'm not very good at design (yet), because I only see pink and lilac colors, however, I'm trying to improve. I'm taking a UX/UI course to bring something different and unique to my users. I tried to incorporate a bit of my personality and journey — from Veterinary Medicine to Programming 💖
